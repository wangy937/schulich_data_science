    "#### **Scenario (c): Regional Restriction**\n",
    "- **Result**: Optimal cost = **2,323,488.50**.\n",
    "- **Explanation**: Restricting processing plants to serve home centers only within the same region aligns with practical logistical considerations. While this constraint slightly increases costs compared to a fully flexible model, it reflects realistic limitations, such as transportation efficiency and regulatory boundaries.\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: **Financially defensible**, as it balances operational feasibility with a manageable cost increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scenario (d): High-Quality Raw Material**\n",
    "- **Result**: Optimal cost = **5,712,976.67**.\n",
    "- **Explanation**: Sourcing only high-quality raw materials (quality 3 and 4) nearly doubles the cost compared to (c). While this may improve product quality, the significant cost increase is unlikely to yield proportional benefits in revenue or market competitiveness.\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: **Not financially defensible**, as the cost increase is excessively high and does not justify the potential benefits.\n",

    "#### **Scenario (e-1): Sourcing Risk Mitigation**\n",

The impact on cost is minimal (slightly lower than (c)), demonstrating that this constraint improves risk management without significantly affecting financial performance.\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: **Financially defensible**, as it enhances supply chain resilience at a negligible cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scenario (e-2): Supply Risk Mitigation**\n",
    "- **Result**: Optimal cost = **2,301,949.78**.\n",
    "- **Explanation**: Restricting a processing facility from supplying more than 50% of a single home center’s demand addresses dependency risk. This constraint reduces cost further compared to (c) and (e-1), indicating an improvement in logistical efficiency and risk distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Risk Mitigation and Supply Chain Resilience**:\n",
    "   - **Sourcing Risk Mitigation (e-1)** ensures no single facility becomes a bottleneck, improving the resilience of the supply chain. The cost impact is minimal (Optimal Cost: **2,311,782.56**).\n",
    "   - **Supply Risk Mitigation (e-2)** prevents over-reliance on specific facilities for fulfilling home center demands, leading to improved distribution (Optimal Cost: **2,301,949.78**).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Operational Feasibility**:\n",
    "   - **Regional Restrictions (c)** reflect logistical realities, ensuring that processing plants serve nearby home centers, which aligns with real-world transportation limitations (Optimal Cost: **2,323,488.50**).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Strategic Cost Control**:\n",
    "   - The combined defensible options (f) result in an optimal cost of **2,337,293.37**, which is only a 0.6% increase over (c). This small cost increment is justified by the enhanced robustness and risk mitigation achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoiding Unsustainable Cost Increases**:\n",
    "   - The high-quality raw material constraint (d) results in a significant cost increase to **5,712,976.67** (+145% vs. (c)), which is financially indefensible compared to the combined defensible options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:\n",
    "While the combined defensible options increase costs slightly, they significantly enhance the robustness, feasibility, and sustainability of the supply chain. This approach ensures long-term resilience and operational efficiency, justifying the additional cost."

    "\n",
    "#### **Key Findings**\n",
    "1. **Threshold for Feasibility**:\n",
    "   - The supply chain becomes infeasible when the sourcing risk mitigation limit drops below **2.4%**.\n",
    "   - At **2.5%**, the model remains feasible with an optimal transportation and procurement cost of **$5,755,911.11**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Managerial Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - **Capacity Limits**: The result highlights that the supply chain has limited flexibility to absorb tighter restrictions on sourcing. Dropping the limit below **2.5%** creates excessive reliance on a few facilities, making the network unsustainable.\n",
    "   - **Risk-Resilience Trade-Off**: While reducing the sourcing risk mitigation percentage might seem desirable to lower dependency risks, the supply chain cannot operate below the threshold due to resource and capacity constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implications for Supply Chain Management**:\n",
    "   - **Balance Constraints**: Managers must carefully balance risk mitigation policies with operational feasibility to avoid disruption.\n",
    "   - **Expand Capacity**: To implement stricter sourcing limits, additional investments in facility capacity or diversification of suppliers may be necessary.\n",
    "   - **Monitor Critical Limits**: The **2.5% threshold** serves as a guide for future policy development, ensuring the supply chain remains robust while addressing risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conclusion**:\n",
    "   - The supply chain’s limited capacity for risk mitigation emphasizes the need for strategic adjustments rather than imposing overly restrictive policies. Maintaining feasible limits is crucial for sustaining operations and achieving long-term goals."

    "### Explanation for Question (b)\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of allocating **a proportion of the workout program to each exercise** is a more practical approach than specifying exact exercises for each session due to several reasons derived from the **assignment requirements** and the **structure of the provided dataset (`updated_gym_data.csv`)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Flexibility in Program Design**\n",
    "   - **Proportional Allocation**: By specifying proportions, the program provides flexibility in selecting exercises to meet diverse goals while adhering to the constraints. This allows customization for different lifters, whether they are beginners, intermediates, or advanced athletes.\n",
    "   - **Dataset Variety**: The dataset contains 2,637 exercises across various body parts, levels, and equipment. Fixing exact exercises for each session would be overly restrictive and fail to utilize the dataset's diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Balancing Constraints Across Multiple Goals**\n",
    "   - The constraints in the assignment (e.g., minimum proportions for specific body parts, SFR limits, and equipment requirements) are easier to satisfy with proportional allocations than with exact exercises.\n",
    "   - For example:\n",
    "     - **Body part constraints**: The requirement to allocate at least 2.5% to most body parts, with specific thresholds for traps, neck, forearms, and abdominals, can be evenly distributed across exercises targeting those muscles without overloading individual sessions.\n",
    "     - **SFR Limit**: Keeping the overall program's stimulus-to-fatigue ratio below 0.55 ensures recovery is optimized without micromanaging fatigue per session.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Adaptability to Time and Recovery**\n",
    "   - **Time Management**: The dataset includes an estimate of the time required to complete 4 sets of 10 reps for each exercise. By allocating proportions, lifters can adjust the time spent on workouts to match their schedules.\n",
    "   - **Recovery Optimization**: Proportional allocation allows the program to include lower-fatigue exercises for active recovery or balance high-fatigue exercises across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Practicality for Diverse Populations**\n",
    "   - A proportional program ensures inclusivity for lifters with different preferences or access to equipment:\n",
    "     - Some may prefer barbell-based exercises, while others rely on machines or bands.\n",
    "     - Not all gyms or home setups provide access to all equipment types.\n",
    "   - By focusing on proportions, the program ensures that lifters can substitute exercises within the allocated categories while meeting the overall fitness goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Alignment with Data Analytics**\n",
    "   - The dataset provides detailed metrics (e.g., SFR, hypertrophy ratings, and estimated time). A proportional allocation allows optimization based on these metrics, creating a data-driven plan that maximizes hypertrophy while satisfying constraints.\n",
    "   - Specifying exact exercises would not leverage the dataset's analytics capabilities, such as:\n",
    "     - **Maximizing overall hypertrophy rating**: A proportional approach uses ratings across multiple exercises rather than focusing on single, potentially suboptimal choices.\n",
    "     - **Meeting proportional constraints**: Constraints like 2.6x leg-to-upper-body allocation are better balanced with proportional distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Long-Term Sustainability**\n",
    "   - Proportional allocation allows lifters to rotate or substitute exercises within the defined categories without disrupting the program's overall goals. This prevents overuse injuries, ensures variety, and keeps workouts engaging.\n",
    "   - For instance:\n",
    "     - Lifters can alternate between squats and lunges within the leg allocation or between barbell and dumbbell chest presses within the chest allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "Allocating a proportion of the workout program to each exercise leverages the richness of the dataset and the versatility of linear programming. It allows for a balanced, adaptable, and practical fitness program tailored to individual goals and constraints, avoiding the rigidity and impracticality of specifying exact exercises for every session."

    "To answer Question (e), we will analyze whether increasing the minimum proportions for Traps, Neck, Forearms, or Abdominals would provide value, using the results from parts (b), (c), and (d). Here's the structured approach to address the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Based on Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Results from Question (c)**:\n",
    "   - The optimal hypertrophy rating was **0.7665**, using all constraints.\n",
    "   - Exercises targeting Traps, Neck, Forearms, and Abdominals were included in small proportions:\n",
    "     - Lying Face Down Plate Neck Resistance (Neck): 0.0050\n",
    "     - Rickshaw Carry (Traps): 0.0050\n",
    "     - Crucifix (Forearms): 0.0250\n",
    "     - 30 Barbell Floor Wiper (Abdominals): 0.0400\n",
    "\n",
    "   These values indicate that the lower bounds set for these muscles were utilized, suggesting that their proportions are minimally sufficient to meet constraints but might not contribute much to the overall hypertrophy rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Results from Question (d)**:\n",
    "   - Relaxing the SFR constraint by 0.001 led to a **small improvement in hypertrophy rating (0.0014)**, resulting in a relaxed optimal hypertrophy rating of **0.7679**.\n",
    "   - The improvement was minor and valid since the relaxation was small and the SFR constraint remained within reasonable bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "   This suggests that the hypertrophy rating is already close to being optimized, and significant improvements may not be achievable through minor changes in constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Insights from the Dataset**:\n",
    "   - These muscles (Traps, Neck, Forearms, and Abdominals) often have lower hypertrophy ratings and stimulus-to-fatigue ratios compared to other major muscle groups (e.g., Quadriceps, Glutes).\n",
    "   - Increasing their minimum proportions would likely reduce the overall hypertrophy rating because higher-proportion allocations would need to come from muscles or exercises with higher ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion for Question (e):\n",
    "Increasing the minimum proportions for Traps, Neck, Forearms, or Abdominals is unlikely to provide significant value for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Minimal Contribution to Hypertrophy Rating**:\n",
    "   - The exercises targeting these muscles were included in the solution at the minimum required proportions, indicating their limited contribution to maximizing hypertrophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Opportunity Cost**:\n",
    "   - Increasing their proportions would require reducing allocations to other muscle groups (e.g., Legs or Chest), which generally have higher hypertrophy ratings and SFR values. This trade-off could decrease the overall hypertrophy rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SFR and Hypertrophy Limitations**:\n",
    "   - These muscles tend to have exercises with lower stimulus-to-fatigue ratios, meaning that their inclusion may disproportionately increase fatigue without significant hypertrophy benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation:\n",
    "- There is little value in increasing the minimum proportions for Traps, Neck, Forearms, or Abdominals in the current model.\n",
    "- However, if specific training goals (e.g., neck strengthening or grip improvement) are prioritized, increasing these proportions might be justified despite a potential decrease in the overall hypertrophy rating.\n",
    "\n",
