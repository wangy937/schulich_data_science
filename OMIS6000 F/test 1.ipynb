    "#### **Scenario (c): Regional Restriction**\n",
    "- **Result**: Optimal cost = **2,323,488.50**.\n",
    "- **Explanation**: Restricting processing plants to serve home centers only within the same region aligns with practical logistical considerations. While this constraint slightly increases costs compared to a fully flexible model, it reflects realistic limitations, such as transportation efficiency and regulatory boundaries.\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: **Financially defensible**, as it balances operational feasibility with a manageable cost increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scenario (d): High-Quality Raw Material**\n",
    "- **Result**: Optimal cost = **5,712,976.67**.\n",
    "- **Explanation**: Sourcing only high-quality raw materials (quality 3 and 4) nearly doubles the cost compared to (c). While this may improve product quality, the significant cost increase is unlikely to yield proportional benefits in revenue or market competitiveness.\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: **Not financially defensible**, as the cost increase is excessively high and does not justify the potential benefits.\n",

    "#### **Scenario (e-1): Sourcing Risk Mitigation**\n",

The impact on cost is minimal (slightly lower than (c)), demonstrating that this constraint improves risk management without significantly affecting financial performance.\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: **Financially defensible**, as it enhances supply chain resilience at a negligible cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scenario (e-2): Supply Risk Mitigation**\n",
    "- **Result**: Optimal cost = **2,301,949.78**.\n",
    "- **Explanation**: Restricting a processing facility from supplying more than 50% of a single home center’s demand addresses dependency risk. This constraint reduces cost further compared to (c) and (e-1), indicating an improvement in logistical efficiency and risk distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Risk Mitigation and Supply Chain Resilience**:\n",
    "   - **Sourcing Risk Mitigation (e-1)** ensures no single facility becomes a bottleneck, improving the resilience of the supply chain. The cost impact is minimal (Optimal Cost: **2,311,782.56**).\n",
    "   - **Supply Risk Mitigation (e-2)** prevents over-reliance on specific facilities for fulfilling home center demands, leading to improved distribution (Optimal Cost: **2,301,949.78**).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Operational Feasibility**:\n",
    "   - **Regional Restrictions (c)** reflect logistical realities, ensuring that processing plants serve nearby home centers, which aligns with real-world transportation limitations (Optimal Cost: **2,323,488.50**).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Strategic Cost Control**:\n",
    "   - The combined defensible options (f) result in an optimal cost of **2,337,293.37**, which is only a 0.6% increase over (c). This small cost increment is justified by the enhanced robustness and risk mitigation achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoiding Unsustainable Cost Increases**:\n",
    "   - The high-quality raw material constraint (d) results in a significant cost increase to **5,712,976.67** (+145% vs. (c)), which is financially indefensible compared to the combined defensible options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:\n",
    "While the combined defensible options increase costs slightly, they significantly enhance the robustness, feasibility, and sustainability of the supply chain. This approach ensures long-term resilience and operational efficiency, justifying the additional cost."

    "\n",
    "#### **Key Findings**\n",
    "1. **Threshold for Feasibility**:\n",
    "   - The supply chain becomes infeasible when the sourcing risk mitigation limit drops below **2.4%**.\n",
    "   - At **2.5%**, the model remains feasible with an optimal transportation and procurement cost of **$5,755,911.11**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Managerial Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - **Capacity Limits**: The result highlights that the supply chain has limited flexibility to absorb tighter restrictions on sourcing. Dropping the limit below **2.5%** creates excessive reliance on a few facilities, making the network unsustainable.\n",
    "   - **Risk-Resilience Trade-Off**: While reducing the sourcing risk mitigation percentage might seem desirable to lower dependency risks, the supply chain cannot operate below the threshold due to resource and capacity constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implications for Supply Chain Management**:\n",
    "   - **Balance Constraints**: Managers must carefully balance risk mitigation policies with operational feasibility to avoid disruption.\n",
    "   - **Expand Capacity**: To implement stricter sourcing limits, additional investments in facility capacity or diversification of suppliers may be necessary.\n",
    "   - **Monitor Critical Limits**: The **2.5% threshold** serves as a guide for future policy development, ensuring the supply chain remains robust while addressing risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conclusion**:\n",
    "   - The supply chain’s limited capacity for risk mitigation emphasizes the need for strategic adjustments rather than imposing overly restrictive policies. Maintaining feasible limits is crucial for sustaining operations and achieving long-term goals."
