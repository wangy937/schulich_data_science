    "\n",
    "We can observe the following differences between the results in **(a)** and **(b)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Observations on Optimal Prices and Revenue**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Optimal Prices (Without Equality Constraint):**\n",
    "   - **Week 1 Optimal Price (\\( P_1 \\)):** $100.00  \n",
    "   - **Week 2 Optimal Price (\\( P_2 \\)):** $105.56  \n",
    "   - **Maximum Total Revenue:** $100,138.89  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimal Price (With Equality Constraint):**\n",
    "   - **Common Price (\\( P_1 = P_2 \\)):** $102.63  \n",
    "   - **Maximum Total Revenue:** $100,065.79  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Revenue Difference:**  \n",
    "   The maximum total revenue without the equality constraint is **$100,138.89**, which is **$73.10 higher** than the revenue with the equality constraint ($100,065.79). This is because dynamic pricing allows each week to have a different optimal price, better aligning with the demand-response functions for those weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Explanation – Why This Occurs**\n",
    "- **Variable Pricing Advantage:**  \n",
    "  In (a), we allowed the prices for Week 1 and Week 2 to be optimized independently. This flexibility enables the price to better match the demand curve for each week, resulting in higher revenue.  \n",
    "  In (b), the same price is enforced across both weeks, which represents a trade-off between the two demand curves, leading to a slightly suboptimal outcome in both weeks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demand Curves Matter:**  \n",
    "  - In Week 1, the optimal price was $100, which aligned perfectly with the demand curve (Intercept: 1000, Own-Price Coefficient: -5).  \n",
    "  - In Week 2, the demand curve had a different structure (Intercept: 950, Own-Price Coefficient: -4.5), leading to a different optimal price of $105.56 when optimized independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **KKT Conditions and Flexibility:**  \n",
    "  - Without the equality constraint, the KKT conditions found the true optimal solution for each week.  \n",
    "  - Adding the constraint \\( P_1 = P_2 \\) introduces a compromise, where the price ($102.63) falls between the two optimal prices from (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Benefit of Dynamic Pricing**\n",
    "- **Higher Revenue Potential:**  \n",
    "  As shown by the difference in total revenue, dynamic pricing allows the company to extract more value by adapting prices to weekly demand patterns. This flexibility is critical in maximizing revenue.  \n",
    "- **Better Demand Matching:**  \n",
    "  By adjusting prices weekly, the company can better capture the willingness to pay of different consumer segments at different times.  \n",
    "- **Seasonality and Market Responsiveness:**  \n",
    "  Dynamic pricing enables the company to respond to seasonality and promotional events (e.g., Black Friday), further enhancing profitability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "- **Static Pricing** simplifies operations but sacrifices potential revenue.  \n",
    "- **Dynamic Pricing** offers superior performance by allowing prices to vary in response to demand changes, leading to optimal results across different market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like, I can also help visualize these differences using a plot comparing the price and revenue under the two scenarios. 😊"
