    "### **Question (c) – Analysis and Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Observation:**\n",
    "From the results obtained in (a) and (b), we observe the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(a) Without the equality constraint**:\n",
    "  - The optimal prices for each week are different:\n",
    "    - Week 1: $100.00\n",
    "    - Week 2: $105.56\n",
    "  - **Maximum Revenue: $100,138.89**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(b) With the equality constraint** (same price for both weeks):\n",
    "  - The optimal price is **$102.63** for both weeks.\n",
    "  - **Maximum Revenue: $100,065.79**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Does This Occur?**\n",
    "The reason for the difference lies in the flexibility of pricing in (a) versus the restriction imposed in (b):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Pricing Flexibility (a)**:\n",
    "   - Allows for adjusting prices each week to match the optimal price-demand combination for that specific week.\n",
    "   - This ensures that the **revenue for each week is maximized individually**, resulting in a higher overall revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Static Pricing Restriction (b)**:\n",
    "   - By forcing the same price across both weeks, the optimization is constrained to a compromise price that may not be optimal for either week.\n",
    "   - As a result, the revenue is slightly lower compared to the dynamic pricing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Benefit of Dynamic Pricing**:\n",
    "Dynamic pricing offers several advantages:\n",
    "1. **Maximized Revenue**: Each week’s price can be optimized based on current demand conditions, yielding higher total revenue.  \n",
    "2. **Improved Demand Management**: Adjusting prices dynamically can help smooth demand fluctuations and avoid shortages or oversupply.  \n",
    "3. **Competitive Advantage**: Allows companies to react to market changes, competitive pressures, and customer preferences more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "The results demonstrate that **dynamic pricing** outperforms static pricing in terms of revenue generation. The small difference in revenue between the two strategies in this case might seem minor, but over a longer period or with a larger dataset, the gap could be significant. Companies like GadgetMarket Inc. should adopt **dynamic pricing** to maximize profitability while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions.\n",
