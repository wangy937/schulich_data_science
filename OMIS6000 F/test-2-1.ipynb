    "\n",
    "We can observe the following differences between the results in **(a)** and **(b)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Observations on Optimal Prices and Revenue**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Optimal Prices (Without Equality Constraint):**\n",
    "   - **Week 1 Optimal Price (\\( P_1 \\)):** $100.00  \n",
    "   - **Week 2 Optimal Price (\\( P_2 \\)):** $105.56  \n",
    "   - **Maximum Total Revenue:** $100,138.89  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimal Price (With Equality Constraint):**\n",
    "   - **Common Price (\\( P_1 = P_2 \\)):** $102.63  \n",
    "   - **Maximum Total Revenue:** $100,065.79  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Revenue Difference:**  \n",
    "   The maximum total revenue without the equality constraint is **$100,138.89**, which is **$73.10 higher** than the revenue with the equality constraint ($100,065.79). This is because dynamic pricing allows each week to have a different optimal price, better aligning with the demand-response functions for those weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Explanation – Why This Occurs**\n",
    "- **Variable Pricing Advantage:**  \n",
    "  In (a), we allowed the prices for Week 1 and Week 2 to be optimized independently. This flexibility enables the price to better match the demand curve for each week, resulting in higher revenue.  \n",
    "  In (b), the same price is enforced across both weeks, which represents a trade-off between the two demand curves, leading to a slightly suboptimal outcome in both weeks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demand Curves Matter:**  \n",
    "  - In Week 1, the optimal price was $100, which aligned perfectly with the demand curve (Intercept: 1000, Own-Price Coefficient: -5).  \n",
    "  - In Week 2, the demand curve had a different structure (Intercept: 950, Own-Price Coefficient: -4.5), leading to a different optimal price of $105.56 when optimized independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **KKT Conditions and Flexibility:**  \n",
    "  - Without the equality constraint, the KKT conditions found the true optimal solution for each week.  \n",
    "  - Adding the constraint \\( P_1 = P_2 \\) introduces a compromise, where the price ($102.63) falls between the two optimal prices from (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Benefit of Dynamic Pricing**\n",
    "- **Higher Revenue Potential:**  \n",
    "  As shown by the difference in total revenue, dynamic pricing allows the company to extract more value by adapting prices to weekly demand patterns. This flexibility is critical in maximizing revenue.  \n",
    "- **Better Demand Matching:**  \n",
    "  By adjusting prices weekly, the company can better capture the willingness to pay of different consumer segments at different times.  \n",
    "- **Seasonality and Market Responsiveness:**  \n",
    "  Dynamic pricing enables the company to respond to seasonality and promotional events (e.g., Black Friday), further enhancing profitability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "- **Static Pricing** simplifies operations but sacrifices potential revenue.  \n",
    "- **Dynamic Pricing** offers superior performance by allowing prices to vary in response to demand changes, leading to optimal results across different market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like, I can also help visualize these differences using a plot comparing the price and revenue under the two scenarios. 😊"

    "### **(e) Why is this optimization problem a Nonlinear Program (NLP)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization problem in this assignment is considered a **Nonlinear Program (NLP)** due to the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Nonlinear Objective Function**\n",
    "The objective is to **maximize total revenue**, which is the product of price and demand for both products:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Revenue}_{\\text{Product}} = P \\times (\\text{Intercept} + \\text{OwnCoeff} \\times P + \\text{CrossCoeff} \\times P_{\\text{Other}})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to a **quadratic objective function**, as the price \\( P \\) is multiplied by a linear expression of \\( P \\), resulting in a term like \\( P^2 \\). Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Revenue}_{\\text{Smartwatch}} = P_{\\text{SW}} \\times (a + b \\times P_{\\text{SW}} + c \\times P_{\\text{EB}})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Revenue}_{\\text{Earbuds}} = P_{\\text{EB}} \\times (d + e \\times P_{\\text{EB}} + f \\times P_{\\text{SW}})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "When combined, the total revenue includes **quadratic terms** like \\( P_{\\text{SW}}^2 \\), \\( P_{\\text{EB}}^2 \\), and cross-product terms like \\( P_{\\text{SW}} \\times P_{\\text{EB}} \\). These nonlinear terms prevent the problem from being linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Cross-Price Elasticity**\n",
    "The demand for each product is influenced by the price of the other product through cross-price coefficients. This introduces **interdependence** between the variables \\( P_{\\text{SW}} \\) and \\( P_{\\text{EB}} \\), resulting in a coupled nonlinear system.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. No Linear Reformulation is Possible**\n",
    "A linear reformulation would require transforming all nonlinear terms (e.g., \\( P^2 \\) and \\( P_{\\text{SW}} \\times P_{\\text{EB}} \\)) into linear ones. This is not feasible because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quadratic terms cannot be expressed as linear combinations** without approximations or piecewise linearization, which reduces accuracy and increases complexity.  \n",
    "- **Cross-product terms \\( P_{\\text{SW}} \\times P_{\\text{EB}} \\)** further complicate the problem, as they represent genuine nonlinear interactions that cannot be eliminated through simple transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Complexity and Real-World Relevance**\n",
    "The nonlinearity accurately reflects the real-world relationship between price and demand. Attempting to linearize the problem would:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lose critical information about how demand responds to price changes.  \n",
    "- Produce suboptimal solutions that may significantly underestimate or overestimate revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "This optimization problem is a nonlinear program due to its **quadratic objective function** and **cross-price interactions**. The problem cannot be linearized without sacrificing accuracy, and solving it as an NLP is essential to capture the true nature of the price-demand relationship.\n",
    "\n",
