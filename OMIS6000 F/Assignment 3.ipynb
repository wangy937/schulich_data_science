    "#### For the optimal objective function value to be positive, the total revenue from distributing brakes must exceed the total fixed cost of establishing the distribution centers. This requires that at least one DC is opened and that the volume of brakes shipped from the open facility or facilities—when multiplied by the corresponding per-unit revenues—is high enough to cover the fixed cost of operating those centers. Essentially, there must exist a feasible solution where the revenue generated from the shipments outweighs the fixed investment required to set up the network, ensuring a net profit greater than zero."

    "#### The linking constraint, formulated as x[i, j] ≤ 0.45 * Demand[j] * y[i], serves a dual purpose. First, it ensures that if a distribution center is not opened (i.e., y[i] = 0), then no brakes can be distributed from that facility (forcing x[i, j] to zero for all regions j). Second, it limits the volume that can be shipped from an open facility to any region to at most 45% of that region’s demand. This linkage is critical in a 10-year capacity planning problem because it ties the irreversible investment decision of opening a facility to its operational use. Essentially, it guarantees that only facilities that are built can contribute to the distribution plan, and even then, they must operate within realistic bounds that reflect regional demand constraints."

    "#### Benchmarking offers a valuable reference point by showing the maximum potential profit without practical constraints. In our model, when all strategic and operational restrictions are omitted, the optimal 10-year profit is approximately \\$483 million. However, once all constraints are included, the profit decreases to about \\$424 million. This roughly \\$59 million gap highlights the trade-offs that come with implementing real-world restrictions—such as location limits, dependency requirements, and shipment caps. For managers, this comparison emphasizes that while a theoretical model might suggest very high profitability, the necessary operational constraints significantly lower this figure. Understanding the cost imposed by these constraints can guide decision-makers in evaluating whether some restrictions might be adjusted or if investments should be made to mitigate their impact, ultimately helping to balance profitability with practical considerations."

    "#### Solving the linear relaxation would indeed simplify the computation by allowing fractional values for the decision variables, but this approach is not practical in our case because the model's key decisions are inherently discrete. In our MILP, variables like \\(y_i\\) represent the decision to open a facility, and they must be binary—either a facility is opened (1) or not (0). When relaxed, these values could fall between 0 and 1 (for example, 0.6), which does not have any real-world interpretation (a facility cannot be \"partially\" open). Moreover, rounding these fractional solutions to obtain an integer solution could lead to infeasibilities or suboptimal outcomes due to the tight coupling between fixed costs, capacities, and shipping decisions. In essence, although LP relaxation provides a computationally faster bound on the objective function, the resulting solution would not be directly implementable for strategic capacity planning over the 10-year period, making the use of full MILP methods necessary to capture the discrete, combinatorial nature of the problem."

This setting biases the branch-and-bound process toward exploring parts of the search tree that are more likely to yield feasible (even if sub-optimal) solutions quickly. Such a configuration is particularly valuable in complex optimization problems where obtaining a good feasible solution in a reasonable amount of time is more critical than proving global optimality.\n"

    "#### Using Gurobi parameters to obtain an approximate MILP solution (for example, by setting a gap tolerance) provides a feasible integer solution that respects all logical and capacity constraints. In contrast, solving the LP relaxation ignores integrality, allowing fractional values that may not be implementable (such as “opening half a facility”). Even if the LP relaxation provides a tight upper bound on the objective, its solution is not directly usable in practice and must be rounded—potentially introducing infeasibilities or significant suboptimality. By configuring Gurobi to stop at a given optimality gap, you ensure the solver returns a valid, integer solution that is within a known percentage of optimal, offering both realism (integer decisions) and efficiency (controlled solve time)."
