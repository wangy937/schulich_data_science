    "#### The linking constraint, formulated as x[i, j] â‰¤ 0.45 * Demand[j] * y[i], serves a dual purpose. First, it ensures that if a distribution center is not opened (i.e., y[i] = 0), then no brakes can be distributed from that facility (forcing x[i, j] to zero for all regions j). Second, it limits the volume that can be shipped from an open facility to any region to at most 45% of that regionâ€™s demand. This linkage is critical in a 10-year capacity planning problem because it ties the irreversible investment decision of opening a facility to its operational use. Essentially, it guarantees that only facilities that are built can contribute to the distribution plan, and even then, they must operate within realistic bounds that reflect regional demand constraints."

    "#### Benchmarking offers a valuable reference point by showing the maximum potential profit without practical constraints. In our model, when all strategic and operational restrictions are omitted, the optimal 10-year profit is approximately \\$483 million. However, once all constraints are included, the profit decreases to about \\$424 million. This roughly \\$59 million gap highlights the trade-offs that come with implementing real-world restrictionsâ€”such as location limits, dependency requirements, and shipment caps. For managers, this comparison emphasizes that while a theoretical model might suggest very high profitability, the necessary operational constraints significantly lower this figure. Understanding the cost imposed by these constraints can guide decision-makers in evaluating whether some restrictions might be adjusted or if investments should be made to mitigate their impact, ultimately helping to balance profitability with practical considerations."

    "#### Solving the linear relaxation would indeed simplify the computation by allowing fractional values for the decision variables, but this approach is not practical in our case because the model's key decisions are inherently discrete. In our MILP, variables like \\(y_i\\) represent the decision to open a facility, and they must be binaryâ€”either a facility is opened (1) or not (0). When relaxed, these values could fall between 0 and 1 (for example, 0.6), which does not have any real-world interpretation (a facility cannot be \"partially\" open). Moreover, rounding these fractional solutions to obtain an integer solution could lead to infeasibilities or suboptimal outcomes due to the tight coupling between fixed costs, capacities, and shipping decisions. In essence, although LP relaxation provides a computationally faster bound on the objective function, the resulting solution would not be directly implementable for strategic capacity planning over the 10-year period, making the use of full MILP methods necessary to capture the discrete, combinatorial nature of the problem."
