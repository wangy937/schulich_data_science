    "### **(c) Answer: Observations and Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Observations**  \n",
    "- In **(a)**, where prices were optimized separately for each week:  \n",
    "  - **Week 1 Optimal Price:** 100  \n",
    "  - **Week 2 Optimal Price:** 105.56  \n",
    "  - This led to more tailored prices, maximizing revenue for each week individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **(b)**, where prices had to be the **same for both weeks**:  \n",
    "  - **Unified Optimal Price:** 102.63  \n",
    "  - This is a compromise between the optimal prices for Week 1 and Week 2. The total revenue is still optimized, but it is slightly lower than the sum of individually optimized weekly revenues from part **(a)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Why Does This Occur?**\n",
    "This difference arises because:\n",
    "- **(a)** allows for **dynamic pricing**, enabling GadgetMarket Inc. to adjust prices based on weekly demand fluctuations.  \n",
    "- **(b)** imposes a **constraint on pricing consistency**, which limits flexibility and forces the price to balance between two different demand curves. This reduces the ability to fully capitalize on varying demand patterns across weeks.  \n",
    "- In pricing optimization, constraints like \"same price across weeks\" often result in **compromised solutions** that may not capture the full revenue potential compared to an unconstrained approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Benefits of Dynamic Pricing**  \n",
    "1. **Higher Revenue Potential**: Dynamic pricing aligns prices with **real-time demand fluctuations**, allowing for better revenue optimization.  \n",
    "2. **Demand Management**: Adjusting prices helps regulate demand and maximize sales during peak and low-demand periods.  \n",
    "3. **Customer Segmentation**: Different prices over time can target different customer segments more effectively.  \n",
    "4. **Competitive Advantage**: Staying agile with pricing helps respond to market trends and competitor actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**  \n",
    "Dynamic pricing, as seen in part **(a)**, offers clear advantages in terms of **revenue maximization and market responsiveness**. While uniform pricing (part **(b)**) is easier to implement and maintain, it sacrifices some of the potential gains available through a more flexible strategy.\n",

    "\n",
    "This optimization problem is a **nonlinear program (NLP)** due to the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nonlinear Objective Function**:  \n",
    "   The revenue function for each product is quadratic in terms of price:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   Revenue = Price \\times (Intercept + Coefficient \\times Price)\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   This results in a **quadratic (nonlinear) term** \\( Price^2 \\) in the objective function. Since the sum of two or more quadratic functions is still nonlinear, the overall optimization problem remains nonlinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coupled Price-Demand Relationship**:  \n",
    "   The demand for one product can be influenced by the price of the other product due to **cross-elasticity effects** (complementarity). This introduces additional nonlinear dependencies between variables in the full model, making it impossible to express the problem as a linear combination of decision variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Constraints Across Multiple Weeks**:  \n",
    "   The requirement to adjust prices dynamically over 17 weeks involves complex conditions, such as:  \n",
    "   - Minimum and maximum prices for specific weeks.  \n",
    "   - Static prices in some periods.  \n",
    "   - Relative price conditions (e.g., Week 17 must have the highest price, Week 12 must have the lowest price).  \n",
    "   These constraints cannot be formulated as simple linear inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why No Linear Reformulation is Possible**\n",
    "1. **Quadratic Objective**: Linear reformulation is only feasible when both the objective function and constraints can be expressed as linear combinations of variables. In this case, the quadratic revenue functions are inherently nonlinear and cannot be approximated without significant loss of accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cross-Elasticity and Interaction Effects**: The interaction between the two productsâ€™ prices (e.g., changes in smartwatch price affecting earbud demand) introduces nonlinear cross-product terms, such as \\( Price_{smartwatch} \\times Price_{earbuds} \\). These terms cannot be linearized without oversimplifying the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complex Dynamic Pricing Constraints**: Constraints that specify relative price changes over different weeks (e.g., \"Week 12 must be $5 lower than any other week\") cannot be represented using simple linear inequalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "This problem is classified as a nonlinear program because of its **quadratic objective function**, **cross-product terms**, and **complex dynamic constraints**. No linear reformulation is possible without oversimplifying or significantly changing the problemâ€™s structure, which would lead to inaccurate solutions and missed revenue optimization opportunities.\n",
