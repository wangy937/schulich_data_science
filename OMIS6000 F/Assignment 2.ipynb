    "### **(c) Answer: Observations and Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Observations**  \n",
    "- In **(a)**, where prices were optimized separately for each week:  \n",
    "  - **Week 1 Optimal Price:** 100  \n",
    "  - **Week 2 Optimal Price:** 105.56  \n",
    "  - This led to more tailored prices, maximizing revenue for each week individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **(b)**, where prices had to be the **same for both weeks**:  \n",
    "  - **Unified Optimal Price:** 102.63  \n",
    "  - This is a compromise between the optimal prices for Week 1 and Week 2. The total revenue is still optimized, but it is slightly lower than the sum of individually optimized weekly revenues from part **(a)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Why Does This Occur?**\n",
    "This difference arises because:\n",
    "- **(a)** allows for **dynamic pricing**, enabling GadgetMarket Inc. to adjust prices based on weekly demand fluctuations.  \n",
    "- **(b)** imposes a **constraint on pricing consistency**, which limits flexibility and forces the price to balance between two different demand curves. This reduces the ability to fully capitalize on varying demand patterns across weeks.  \n",
    "- In pricing optimization, constraints like \"same price across weeks\" often result in **compromised solutions** that may not capture the full revenue potential compared to an unconstrained approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Benefits of Dynamic Pricing**  \n",
    "1. **Higher Revenue Potential**: Dynamic pricing aligns prices with **real-time demand fluctuations**, allowing for better revenue optimization.  \n",
    "2. **Demand Management**: Adjusting prices helps regulate demand and maximize sales during peak and low-demand periods.  \n",
    "3. **Customer Segmentation**: Different prices over time can target different customer segments more effectively.  \n",
    "4. **Competitive Advantage**: Staying agile with pricing helps respond to market trends and competitor actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**  \n",
    "Dynamic pricing, as seen in part **(a)**, offers clear advantages in terms of **revenue maximization and market responsiveness**. While uniform pricing (part **(b)**) is easier to implement and maintain, it sacrifices some of the potential gains available through a more flexible strategy.\n",
